# Implement Table Controls

## Description

The non-profit has exploded in size with thousands of capybaras flooding their database! Because of this, loading all of the capybaras into the table without any sorting and filtering is creating a horrible user experience. To resolve this issue, we need to implement pagination, sorting, and filtering.

Our designers are currently on vacation, so feel free to leave the control elements unstyled! However, please try to retain as much of the original table styling as possible.

## Success Criteria

- There are elements to control the number of elements per page and the current page.
- There are elements to sort by the name and age columns.
- There are elements to filter by status and favorite food.
